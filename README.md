# Rails Engine - An Internal API

This project was designed to mimic a sales data API, where you can query merchants, customers, invoices, transactions, and their associations.

To interact with the API:

1. Clone down the [test harness](https://github.com/turingschool/rales_engine_spec_harness)
2. Clone down this repository.
3. Navigate into rails_engine.
4. Run ```Bundle```
5. Create the database with ```rake db:setup```
6. Seed the database with ```rake rails_engine:seed```
7. Start a local Rails Server with ```rails s```
8. In a seperate instance of Terminal, navigate into the test harness and run ```Bundle```
9. Run ```rake``` to run the suite.
